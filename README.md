# Oba/Browser-technologies
In this document I will apply some browser-technologies cases
towards my code.  

:fire:[LINK](https://sam-guliker.github.io/oba/):fire: to the project.

## Progressive Enhancement
With this list I will try to make my code more accessible and useful for every user.  I made a list to try and tackle this subject.

## Tools
These are the tools I will be using to test my website for optimalization and accessibility.  

[developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/about?hl=en-US&utm_source=PSI&utm_medium=incoming-link&utm_campaign=PSI) Tests on speed and optimalization.  

[Sim Daltonism](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sim-daltonism/id693112260?mt=12) with this tool you can test on different colours.  This way you can test if your website is still working for people that are colourblind.  

### The list:
* Images
* Custom fonts
* Javascript
* Colours
* Broad band
* Cookies
* localStorage
* Mouse/trackpad

## Images
I'm not using any images for this webpage.    
But the stuff I can do for it is for example bringing  alt tags towards the code and maybe some aria labels if  I want to give some extra information.  

### Alt tag
An ALTernative text describing the image.

```HTML

  <img src="images/cat-image.svg" alt="This is a black fluffy cat.">

```

### Aria Labels
Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) can be used to help people with disabilities.


```HTML
  <button aria-label="Close" type="button" name="button">x</button>
```

## Fonts
I'm using the google web-fonts that are from another CDN.  
This means when the CDN server is down it will load the fallback fonts.

### Alternative
You can load the fonts in from your own webpage.  

## Javascript
Trying my website without Javascript...  
Well this wont work :pensive:  The API loads in my data
and Javascript generates the map.

## Colours
Different colourblind tests using Sin Daltonism
